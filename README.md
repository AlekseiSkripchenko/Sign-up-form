### In this project I created a sign-up web page that allows users to send their data to the server.
---
### Follow the steps to launch the project:
- Install `Node.JS`
- Clone the repository: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/AlekseiSkripchenko/Sign-up-form
```
- Initialize `Node Package Manager (npm)` using:
```
$ npm init
```
- In `.env` file you shoud put your own (unique) values: `API key` and `Server prefix`.
    - To get these you have to register a new account on [Mailchimp.com](https://mailchimp.com/)
### Done! Now you can [check it out](https://signup-app.glitch.me) yourself!
